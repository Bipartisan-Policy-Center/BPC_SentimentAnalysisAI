Foreword 


At the brink of entering into a new decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) seems to be shrouded under a cloud of ambivalence. On one hand, we expect advances in AI to bring significant benefits to businesses and citizens. On the other hand, there is increasing anxiety over the impact of AI on the workplace and in our societies, particularly around the implications for ethics and accountability. 
There are no easy answers. Getting the balance right will be a crucial challenge that our generation will need to tackle and one that requires the collaboration and support of multiple stakeholders - enterprises, governments, civil society organizations and academics. Importantly, we believe that it is about adopting a pragmatic approach, putting principles into operations and taking concrete steps to build trust in AI deployments. 
In January 2019, Singapore released Asia’s first Model AI Governance Framework (Model Framework). The Model Framework translates AI ethical principles into practical measures for organizations to adopt voluntarily, such as in internal governance structures, decision-making models and operations management practices. 
This year, we have taken another step forward by publishing the Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide for Organizations (ISAGO). This Guide provides a set of questions and practical examples to enable organizations to assess the alignment of their AI governance practices with the Model Framework. Professionals who are proficient in AI governance could use ISAGO to help organizations implement the Model Framework or assess an organisation’s implementation. 
We are pleased to have partnered with the World Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution to co-develop ISAGO, in close consultation with the industry. We are also grateful for the support and contributions by over 60 local and international organizations to ISAGO. 
We are still very much at the beginning of this long journey, with many more questions than answers. But with the willingness to ask the right questions, work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders and take a pragmatic approach to problem-solving, we believe that it is possible to nurture a safe and trusted environment for AI innovation. The Model Framework and Guide are Singapore’s contribution to this important global discussion, and we welcome views and fellow travellers.

Managing Director, the World Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network 
The Fourth Industrial Revolution’s advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have spurred the global economy, starting a conversation on the role technology plays in our society. Companies and governments alike have embraced innovation as a way to help create more inclusive and responsible communities. 

However, AI and technologies in the Fourth Industrial Revolution have created unique challenges that require new frameworks and pragmatic solutions to ensure an equitable, ethical and fair future for our society. Maximizing the benefits of new technologies while mitigating the unintended consequences will safeguard the positive impact possible with these technologies. In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we see first movers capturing the advancements of AI, but it will be paramount that these technologies are used responsibly. 
The first edition of the Model AI Governance Framework built the principles of what responsible AI would look like and allowed Singapore to contribute to the global discussion on the ethics of AI. Over the past year, the World Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Singapore's Personal Data Protection Commission have co-developed the Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide for Organizations to complement the Model AI Governance Framework. The Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide aims to help organizations assess their AI governance processes. In doing so, organizations can identify potential gaps in their AI governance processes and address them accordingly. The Guide also provides examples of how organizations could implement the considerations and practices set out in the Model AI Governance Framework. 
The project will be released in tandem with work completed by the Singapore Government to expound on the resources for companies to apply the responsible use of AI. First, a second edition of the Model AI Governance Framework will be released with new considerations brought about by advancement in the field and includes illustrations from companies on how to apply these practices. Second, the release of a Compendium of Use Cases will outline use case examples showing organizations how companies have operationalized the principles from the Model AI Governance Framework. 
Inclusive and accountable policies like the Model AI Governance Framework will be vital to addressing these new challenges brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 


Introduction 
In collaboration with the World Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) have developed this Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide for Organizations (ISAGO), a companion to complement the voluntary Model AI Governance Framework1 (Model Framework). This Guide is meant to be a living document and aims to help organizations assess the alignment of their AI governance processes with the Model Framework, identify potential gaps in their existing processes and address them accordingly. 


The Model Framework is published by the PDPC and provides guidance to private sector organizations deploying AI at scale on how to do so in a responsible manner. The Model Framework translates ethical principles into implementable practices, applicable to a common AI deployment process. It covers four key areas: 
A 

Internal governance structures and measures 

B 

Determining the level of human involvement in AI-augmented decision-making 
C 
Operations management 

D 
Stakeholder interaction and communication 




Who should use this Guide? 
The Model Framework and this Guide are intended to guide organizations that procure and deploy AI solutions and use them to offer products and/or services to their customers or consumers. For example, a retail company may use the Guide when deploying AI to make product recommendations to consumers based on their profiles. An insurance company may use the Guide when deploying AI to determine the premium and approve the application for an insurance product. 
The Model Framework and this Guide can also be used by organizations using AI to improve their operational efficiency or to collaborate with other organizations. For example, an organization may use AI to identify anomalies in its transactions and flag them for the relevant department’s attention. This Guide is not intended for organizations that are deploying updated commercial off-the-shelf software packages that happen to incorporate AI in their feature set. 



How should this Guide be used? 
The Guide sets out a list of questions, based on and organized according to the four key areas described in the Model Framework, for organizations to consider in a systematic manner. Hence, this Guide should be read in conjunction with the Model Framework. Organizations should refer to the Model Framework for definitions of terms and explanations of concepts used in this Guide. 
The Guide also provides references and examples on how organizations could implement the considerations and practices set out in the Model Framework. These references and examples include publications by the PDPC (e.g. advisory guidelines and guides), and industry use cases and practices that have been shared with the PDPC. We have also included a list of international AI standards that are being developed (Annex). Organizations are free to implement other measures that best fit the purpose and context of their AI deployment, as appropriate. 
Organizations should not attempt to implement all the practices and considerations in this Guide because not all practices and considerations may be applicable in their context. Additionally, a number of considerations may only be applicable in specific scenarios. These have been marked with the label “Relevant only in limited scenarios”. This would help organizations prioritize their implementation of AI governance measures. 
When using the Guide, organizations should consider whether the questions and practices are relevant to their unique business context and industry. Organizations would also need to consider their business needs, resource constraints, regulatory requirements and specific use cases. Generally, an organization should consider adopting a risk-based approach to AI governance that is commensurate with the potential harm of the AI solution deployed. The scope of the questions in the Guide may overlap and could reinforce concepts that are important in ensuring responsible deployment of AI. Last but not least, organizations are encouraged to document the development of their governance process as a matter of good practice. 
Section 1: Objectives of deploying AI 
To guide organizations on how to include ethical considerations in developing their business case to deploy AI 
Guiding questions Useful industry examples, practices and guides for consideration 
Considerations prior to deployment of AI: 
1.1 Has your organization – Consider whether AI is able to address the identified problem or issue defined a clear purpose in using the identified AI solution 
(e.g. operational efficiency and cost reduction)? 

1.2 Has your organization – Consider whether to conduct a cost-benefit analysis considered conducting an assessment on whether – Consider whether it is useful to leverage benchmarks and case studies for the expected benefits of similar AI solutions (e.g. PDPC’s Compendium of Use Cases2), and adopt implementing the identified the AI governance practices for your organization’s identified AI solution, AI solution in a responsible where applicable. These could be case studies applied in other geographies, manner (as described in the industries or domains, but with similarities to your organization’s use case Model Framework) outweighs the expected costs? 
1.3 Did your organization consider – Consider developing a set of ethical principles that is in line with or can be whether the decision to use AI incorporated into the organization’s mission statement. In addition, it would for a specific application/use be useful to outline how to adopt (e.g. contextualise) them in practice case is consistent with its core values and/or – Consider developing a Code of Ethics for the use of AI. Relevant areas to societal expectations? consider include: 
– 
Regulatory risks (e.g. compliance with Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) and sectoral regulations) 

– 
Public relations risks (e.g. public perception towards the organization's AI practices) 

– 
Costs (e.g. impact of incorporating governance practices into the organization’s current legacy business models and organizational structure) 

– 
Resources and internal champions to drive responsible implementation of AI 


Section 2: Internal governance structures and measures 
To guide organizations to develop appropriate internal governance structures 
Guiding questions Useful industry examples, practices and guides for consideration 
2.1 Does your organization have an – Consider whether it is useful to adapt existing governance, risk and existing governance structure compliance (GRC) structures to incorporate AI governance processes that can be leveraged to oversee the organization’s To provide oversight on the use of data and AI within an organization: use of AI? 
– Consider a sandbox type of governance to test-bed and deploy AI solutions, 
2.2 If your organization does not before fully-fledged governance structures are put in place 
have an existing structure to tap on, has your organization put in – Consider whether it is necessary to establish a committee comprising place a governance structure to representatives from relevant departments (e.g. legal/compliance, technical oversee the organization’s and sales and communication) to oversee AI governance in the organization use of AI? with proper terms of reference (e.g. refine organization’s AI governance 
frameworks to ensure they meet the organization’s commercial, legal, ethical and reputational requirements) 


– 
Consider whether to implement a process where each department head develops and is accountable for the controls and policies that pertain to the respective areas, overseen by relevant subject matter experts such as chief security officer and data protection officer 

– 
Consider whether it is necessary to establish checks and balances: 

– 
An internal team consisting of relevant departments to oversee methodology, algorithms and deployment of AI 

– 
A separate team to conduct validation 




If there are strong concerns about how AI is being used for the project, neither of the teams will be able to one-sidedly terminate the project, but they can conduct further testing and validation. 

– 
Consider whether AI governance processes will ensure that the deployment of AI solutions complies with existing laws and regulations (e.g. trials for autonomous vehicles should comply with Road Traffic (Autonomous Motor Vehicles) Rules 2017; the deployment of AI solutions should comply with Singapore’s Competition Act and should not result in collusive outcomes) 

– 
Consider developing a handbook that outlines the entire governance process for AI deployment and make the handbook available to all staff 




In implementing the governance structure, organizations may consider determining appropriate features such as: 
– 
Adopting a centralized or decentralized decision-making approach based on certain guidelines: 

– 
Take a centralized decision-making approach. For the deployment of an AI solution that is not determined to be low risk or could be potentially contentious, respective departments to bring the issue to the senior management or the AI ethics committee 

– 
Take a decentralized decision-making approach. Respective departments can make the decision on whether to deploy the AI solution based on a predetermined whitelist and/or blacklist. Considerations that could be included in a blacklist are AI applications that would likely cause overall harm and direct injury. Having clear policies that describe off-limits practices (i.e. blacklist) would be useful for organizations that adopt decentralized models where tracking AI is more challenging 



– 
Exploring an approach that takes less time to review/recalibrate AI models to be more resource-efficient, if the model validation processes take a long period of time 

– 
Conducting regular reviews of their governance processes and structures 


2.3 Did your organization’s board – Consider whether it is useful to form a committee/board that is chaired by and/or senior management the senior management and include senior leaders from the various teams sponsor, support and (e.g. chief data officer, chief privacy officer and chief information security participate in your organization’s officer). Including key decision-makers is critical for efficiency and the AI governance? credibility of the committee/board 
– Consider having top management set clear expectations/directions for AI governance within the organization 
Clear roles and responsibilities for the ethical deployment of AI 
2.4 Are the responsibilities of – Consider whether it is useful or practical for the board and senior the personnel involved in management to champion responsible AI deployment and ensure that the various AI governance all employees are committed to implementing the practices: processes clearly defined? 
– 
Strategic level: Board to be responsible for risk and corporate values, and C-suites translate them into strategies. Committee comprising senior management to approve the AI models 

– 
Implementation level: While there is oversight from the senior management, individual project team leads and officers should be held accountable for the AI projects. The roles, responsibilities for managing model risks and ensuring regulatory compliance should be clearly established and documented. For organizations that have the resources or sophistication to have a dedicated regulatory/compliance team, this team could check for relevant existing legal restrictions or compliance requirements for the deployment. At the same time, the regulatory team engages their clients to receive feedback on ethical issues as they implement AI-enabled solutions/services 



– 
Consider defining separate responsibilities for business and technical staff: 

– 
Business staff responsible for defining business goals and business rules, and checking that an AI system behaves consistently with those goals and rules 

– 
Technical staff responsible for data practices, security, stability, error handling 



– 
Consider conducting a review of job descriptions periodically for roles that involve AI deployment

to when they spot them (e.g.  
subject-matter experts within  
their organizations)?  

Risk management and internal controls 
2.8 Does your organization have an existing risk management system that can be expanded to include AI-related risks? 
2.9 Did your organization implement a risk management system to address risks involved in deploying the identified AI solution (e.g. personnel risk or changes to commercial objectives)? 
– 
Consider implementing an internal policy explanation process to retain details of how decision-making on the deployment of AI was undertaken 

– 
Consider implementing a knowledge management registry to archive relevant documents to ensure proper knowledge transfer 


Section 3: Determining the level of human involvement in AI-augmented decision-making 
To help organizations determine the appropriate extent of human oversight in their AI-augmented decision-making process 
Guiding questions Useful industry examples, practices and guides for consideration 
3.1 Did your organization conduct – Consider whether it is necessary to list all internal and external stakeholders, an impact assessment (e.g. and the impact on them accordingly probability and/or severity of harm) on individuals and – Consider whether it is necessary to assess risks from a technical perspective organizations who are affected (e.g. system integrity tests) and from a personal data protection perspective by the AI solution? (e.g. the PDPC’s Guide to Data Protection Impact Assessments3) 
– 
Consider assessing risk at a societal/end-user level by conducting customer/society group testing 

– 
Consider whether it is necessary for AI-augmented decision-making to reflect prevailing societal norms and values 


3.2 Based on the assessment, did – Consider a human-in-the-loop approach when human judgement is your organization implement able to significantly improve the quality of the decision made (e.g. the appropriate level of human pricing recommendation of million-dollar commodity bids) or when a involvement in AI-augmented human subjective judgment is required (e.g. market share forecasting decision-making? for long-term decisions) 
– 
Consider a human-out-of-the-loop approach when it is not practical to subject every algorithmic recommendation to a human review. For example, when an AI model makes thousands or millions of micro-decisions 

(e.g. spare parts forecast for an airline company and daily replenishment recommendations in a retail environment). For such an approach, it would be important to ensure that the AI system is being developed and deployed in a manner that could provide simple and understandable explanations to individuals on the AI-augmented decision-making 


– 
Consider a human-over-the-loop approach to allow humans to intervene when the situation calls for it. To achieve this, organizations could consider using statistical confidence levels to determine when human is required to intervene (e.g. below a certain threshold, staff could be required to review a particular result generated by the AI model) 

– 
Organizations could also consider the following factors in determining the level of human involvement: 

– 
Risk appetite. For example, organizations could have varying risk appetite in interrupting a transaction made by a retail customer as compared to a transaction made by a corporate customer that could result in more serious consequences (e.g. stopping a payroll) 

– 
User experience of its clients’ customers. For example, organizations might consider favouring a better user experience journey and reduce the level of human intervention 

– 
Operational cost. For example, it might be costly for organizations to have a human to manually review all transactions, especially if there is a high volume of transactions and real-time decision-making is required 






3.3 After deployment, did your – Consider whether it is useful to determine and implement an appropriate organization continually identify, regular review period for retraining the AI model. For example, where review and mitigate risks of image patterns are likely to change slowly (e.g. recognizing cats), to review using the identified AI solution? and retrain the AI model less frequently. For patterns that are likely to change 
faster (e.g. phishing detection), consider a higher frequency of review and retraining 
– 
Consider whether it is necessary to regularly review the AI model to assess the severity of harm to take into account evolving societal norms and values 

– 
Consider defining key performance indicators for AI model’s performance and alerting relevant staff when AI performance deteriorates 

– 
Consider tracking the characteristics of the data that the AI is using, versus the data the AI was trained on, and alerting relevant staff when the data drifts too much (e.g. new categories appear, new values outside historical values appear, or the distribution of the values changes) 

– 
Consider developing scenario-based response plans in the event that the risk management efforts fail 


Relevant only in limited scenarios: 
3.4 For safety-critical systems, did – Consider whether it is necessary and feasible to put in place controls to

– 
Consider whether it is useful to track data lineage by putting in place “feature repositories” with application programming interfaces (APIs), databases and files 

– 
Consider whether it is necessary to mandate developers to document data narratives/data diaries for accountability, as well as provide clear explanations of what data is used, how it is collected and why 

– 
Consider whether it is useful to establish a data policy team to manage tracking of data lineage with proper controls 


Relevant only in limited scenarios:

the quality of dataset used?  

Data for Model Development – Minimizing inherent bias  
4.13 Did your organization take steps to mitigate unintended biases in the dataset used for the AI model, especially omission bias and stereotype bias? 
4.14 Did your organization use a complete dataset by not removing data attributes prematurely to minimize risk of inherent bias?  
Relevant only in limited scenarios: 
4.15 Did your organization take steps to mitigate biases that may result from data collection devices (e.g. cameras and sensors)? 

– 
Consider taking steps to mitigate inherent bias in datasets, especially where social or demographic data is being processed for an AI system whose output directly impacts individuals 

– 
Consider defining which data fields contain sensitive or protected attributes. In addition, consider checking for indirect bias by measuring which data fields are predictive of protected and sensitive attributes, and which of those data fields are causative of the target outcomes versus mere proxies for protected and sensitive attributes 

– 
Consider whether it is useful to auto-mosaic any consumer physical features (e.g. face) and other personally identifiable information to prevent this information from being collected if it is not necessary. This could minimize potential risk for bias based on personal data instead of transactional behaviour 

– 
Consider whether it is necessary to identify potential biases of data annotation 

– 
Consider whether not to remove data attributes and data items from the datasets prematurely 

– 
Consider whether it is relevant to use statistical tools to evaluate bias 

(e.g. use “leave one out” to determine over-reliance on variables) – and implement continual monitoring to ensure the AI model stays within pre­defined parameters 


– 
Consider whether it is useful to create an AI library containing datasets to test for potential unintended bias 

– 
Consider defining which measure of bias the organization is trying to detect and remove (e.g. disparate treatment versus disparate impact) 


4.16 Is the dataset used to produce To mitigate selection bias, consider: the AI model fully representative of the actual data or – Benchmarking data distributions against population statistics to identify environment the and quantify how representative the data is AI model may receive or function in? – Whether it is useful to adopt a random assignment approach for the 
sample data 

– 
Whether it is useful to use quality metrics (e.g. completeness, freshness and context) to evaluate whether the dataset used for the AI model is fit for purpose and matches the population it is intended to represent 

– 
Whether it is necessary to use a heterogeneous dataset (i.e. data collected from different demographic groups or from a variety of reliable sources) 

– 
Whether it is necessary to use training data across different communities, events and attributes 


Data for Model Development – Different datasets for training, testing and validation 
4.17 Did your organization use – After training of the AI model, consider validating the AI model using a different datasets for training, separate validation dataset testing and validation of the AI model? – Consider conducting statistical tests (e.g. Area under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic Curve (ROC) and stationarity, multi-collinearity tests) to evaluate and validate the AI model’s ability to predict results 
4.18 Did your organization test the – Consider whether it is necessary to check for data drift between the different AI model used on different datasets and making the AI robust to any differences demographic groups to mitigate systematic bias? – Consider whether it is necessary to test the results of different AI models to 
identify potential biases produced by a certain model 
Relevant only in limited scenarios: 
4.19 Did your organization split a large dataset into subsets to mitigate risks of systematic bias when validating the AI model? 

Data for Model Development – Periodic review and updating of datasets 
4.20 Did your organization To ensure data accuracy, quality, currency, relevance and reliability, consider: periodically review and update datasets to ensure its accuracy, – Whether it would be useful to schedule regular review of datasets quality, currency, relevance and reliability? – Whether it would be necessary to update the dataset periodically with new 
data that was obtained from the actual use of the AI model deployed in

minimize reinforcement bias? – Allocating the responsibility to a relevant personnel to monitor on a regular basis whether new data is available 
– 
Exploring if there are tools available that can automatically notify your organization when new data becomes available 

– 
Deploying a new challenger model that shadows all of the predictions and decisions made by the main AI model, and train the challenger model on newer data than the main AI model. Flag when the challenger model is consistently outperforming the main deployed AI model as this indicates that the patterns in the data have changed and that the old data is no longer valid. This would be a trigger for a review of the data, and your organization would need to consider if the challenger model should become the new main deployed model 

– 
Regularly retrain and build a new adversarial machine learning model that predicts whether a data row is from the current period or from the AI training period. If the adversarial model cannot predict significantly different probabilities for the data source-time period, you know that the data has not changed. However, if it has any success in predicting the source of any rows, that indicates that your data is changing and highlights how it is changing. This should trigger a review of the data and possibly retraining of the AI 

– 
Mitigating bias by post-processing the model if the model bias is explainable and is in line with the bias in the data. For example, if the result from the AI model does not give a desired feature (e.g. gender mix) but the training model exhibits similar bias, consider running two AI models – one for each gender – and get the desired gender mix as a post-processing step. If the AI model bias is not understood, your organization has to evaluate whether the model is still applicable to the case it is used for
